Final Fantasy X External Hack I am writting in C++. Some features work but it is far from finished.

Simple menu is made through input / out of the console. 

Externally hooked a function and wrote bytes directly to memory to create our GodMode & 1HitKO features.

Working features are as follows:

GODMODE & 1HITKO
Max Gil 
Infinite Gil
All Items (1 of any item you do not already have.)
Max Items (99 all items, one time)
Infinite Items (99 all items, does not run out)
Infinite Health
Infinite MP
Infinite Overdrive
Temp Max Stats for all characters
Perm Max Stats for all characters
